# Musical-Notes-Sheet
Developed by: Richard Tu and Phillip Mann  
Made in: June 2016  
Musical Notes Sheet with 4 different views: Console, GUI, MIDI, and Composite.  
Console will provide the user of a ASCII art styled vertical music sheet.  
GUI will provide the user with a Graphic User Interface of a music sheet.  
MIDI will provide the user with audio using the Java MIDI library to play notes.  
The Composite view will provide the user with a GUI view along with the audio from the MIDI view.  
The GUI will allow the user to add notes by clicking or dragging to set a note's pitch, octave, and duration. One can also increase/decrease both the octaves column and the measure rows. A red bar shows the music sheet's current play position as well.
